It is Server Side Java program that is used to create dynamic web application, servlet provide set of classes and method to implement web programing business code.

Servlet class defined under javax.http package, Java provide HttpServlet class to create Servlet.

It has two predefined method

1)  doGet():-  this method will work to implement Http Get Request of Web application.





2)  doPost():-  this method will work to implement Http Post Request of Web application.



Syntax of Servlet:-

class Classname extends HttpServlet
{
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletReponse response)
    {


    }
     public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletReponse response)
    {


    }

}


note:-  we we request any web url directly means without form then doGet() will call.

when we submit application data using form component then form method decide that method is post or get.

<form method="get">


</form>

it will call doGet() of servlet

<form method="post">

</form>

it will call doPost() of Servlet
